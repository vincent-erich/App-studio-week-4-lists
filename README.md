TO-DO LIST 1.0 - The application is a simple to-do list. Initially, the application is empty and
has nothing in the to-do list. If the user types text into the bottom EditText and clicks the 'ADD'
button, the new item will be added to the bottom of the list. If the user clicks on an item, the
text is converted to speech. If the user long-clicks on an item, the item is removed from the list.
The application gracefully handles rotation from portrait to landscape orientation.

<b>Note</b>: The application supports SDK's >= 8 (SDK 23 targeted).
