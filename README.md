MyToDoList 1.0 - The application is a simple to-do list. Initially, the application is empty and
has nothing in the to-do list. But if the user types text into the bottom EditText and clicks the 'ADD'
button, the new item will be added to the bottom of the list.

If the user clicks on an item in the to-do list, the text is converted to speech. If the user long-
clicks on an item, the item is removed from the list. The application gracefully handles rotation
from portrait to landscape orientation. Furthermore, the application doesn't forget the to-do items
when the app is exited and re-entered later, or when the device is rebooted.

<b>Note</b>: The application supports SDK's >= 8 (SDK 23 targeted).
